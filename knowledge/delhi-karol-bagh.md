## How LastMinuteMandy should use this file

Example wording:

- “Karol Bagh got around **2.5/5 for night safety** and **2.5/5 for quietness** in our small local survey — so both safety and noise feel mixed.”
- “Late-night food options were rated **2.9/5**, and **3 of 11** locals said cabs/autos can be tricky at odd hours.”
- “No one in this sample saw Karol Bagh as a nightlife hub.”

Clearly label this as **perception data from 11 locals**, not a definitive rating.
