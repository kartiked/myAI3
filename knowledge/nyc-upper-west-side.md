# Area: New York – Upper West Side (UWS)

## City
New York

## Safety (solo women)
Score: 4/5  
Summary: Generally considered one of Manhattan’s safer, more residential neighborhoods. Well-lit main avenues and steady foot traffic from families, professionals, and students. Feels secure for solo women, especially compared to busier, rowdier areas downtown.

## Noise
Score: 3/5  
Summary: Quieter than Midtown and downtown. Main avenues have traffic and bus noise, but side streets and residential blocks are relatively peaceful. Not a heavy nightlife zone.

## Vibe
Leafy, cultured, and family-oriented. Close to Central Park and Riverside Park, with museums (like the American Museum of Natural History), cafés, and classic apartment buildings. Feels “lived-in local New York” rather than touristy.

## Night lighting
Good along Broadway, Amsterdam, and Columbus avenues. Side streets are calmer but still reasonably lit for normal evening walks.

## Late-night food
Score: 4/5  
Summary: Plenty of restaurants and casual spots open fairly late, along with 24-hour groceries and decent delivery coverage. Not a clubbing or bar-hopping area, but strong for everyday eating.

## Transport & accessibility
Very good. Served by the 1/2/3 subway lines and crosstown buses, making it easy to reach Midtown and other parts of Manhattan. Walkable to parks and many cultural spots.

## Best for
Families, solo women, longer stays, people who want balance: city access + calmer residential feel; culture lovers who like parks and museums.

## Overall short summary
The UWS is a classic, comfortable Manhattan neighborhood — safe-feeling, walkable, and not overwhelmingly touristy. Great base if you want to experience “real city life” without Midtown chaos.
