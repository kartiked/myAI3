# Area: New York – Staten Island

## City
New York

## Safety (solo women)
Score: 4/5  
Summary: Generally calm, suburban, and family-oriented. Crime is relatively low and streets can feel safe, though some areas are quiet/empty at night. Feels very different from the dense, chaotic parts of Manhattan.

## Noise
Score: 2.5/5  
Summary: Considerably quieter than other boroughs. Main roads can be busy, but many residential streets are peaceful.

## Vibe
Suburban, spread-out, and community-focused. More houses, trees, and local shops; fewer high-rises and tourists. Great for people who like space and calm; not exciting for those seeking “classic New York” buzz.

## Night lighting
Moderate. Commercial streets are lit; many residential areas are darker and lightly trafficked after hours.

## Late-night food
Score: 3.5/5  
Summary: Good local food scene (especially Italian-American and pizza), but not intense nightlife. There are some late spots, but far fewer options than Manhattan or Brooklyn.

## Transport & accessibility
The free Staten Island Ferry connects to Lower Manhattan and is iconic but adds commute time. Within the island, buses and cars are the main modes; traffic on certain routes can be heavy. Less convenient for quick trips into central Manhattan.

## Best for
Families, people who prefer suburban calm over city chaos, travellers who don’t mind longer commutes in exchange for quiet and space.

## Overall short summary
Staten Island feels like a quieter suburb attached to NYC: safe and spacious, but not ideal as a base if your goal is fast, frequent access to Manhattan sights and nightlife.
